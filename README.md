# EulerianCircleFinder
 Implementing an algorithm that finds an eulerian circle in a graph in C++:
 This program finds an Euler circle in a graph if it exists 
 (the graph can be directed or undirected, depending on the user's choice - y if directed, or no if undirected).
 Then, the program asks the user for the number of vertices in the graph (n), then for the number of edges (m), 
 and then for the edges themselves (a sequence of pairs of vertices {1, ... , n}).
